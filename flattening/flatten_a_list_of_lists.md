# Python: Flatten a list of lists

## Logic

```python
forest = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
flattened = []
for tree in forest:
	for leaf in tree:
		flattened.append(leaf)
```

## Nested list comprehension

```python
flattened = [leaf for tree in forest for leaf in tree]
```

Perhaps counterintuitively, the `for ... in` statements follow the same order as in the nested `for` version, which ensures that all variables are defined before being referenced.

## `itertools` functions

See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5239856/asterisk-in-function-call>.

### `itertools.chain()`

```python
import itertools
flattened = itertools.chain(*forest)
```

`flattened` is an interator. If necessary, expand it with `list(flattened)`.

The splat takes a list as input and expands it into positional arguments in a function call.

### `itertools.chain.from_iterable()`

```python
flattened = itertools.chain.from_iterable(forest)
```

This assumes that the argument is an iterable, so we don’t need the star to unpack it into its components. This is more efficient when the trees are generators, rather than lists, since we don’t need to create the entire lists in order to flatten them.  Also produces an iterator, as above.
