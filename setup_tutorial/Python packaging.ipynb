Once you’ve done that, you can run it from the command line with `./filename.py`. If you do this, you must begin the file with a shebang:\n",

For example, to install the [CollateX](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collatex/2.1.0) collation toolkit, type `pip install collatex` at the command line. You can then import from CollateX the same way you import from `re`. Once you’ve installed a PyPI module with `pip`, you can import and use it in the same way as you import and use standard modules.

But we can do that only if Python can find those modules. Python finds modules by consulting a search space, which by default is, in order (copied from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html):\n",

    "\n",
    "Builtins are always available, and both standard modules and those installed from PyPI with `pip` are placed into a location that is part of PYTHONPATH. We cannot, however, use `pip` to install modules that we write ourself unless we deposit those in PyPI. (There is also a `pip install -e` option for installing from local files, but it has undesirable limitations, about which see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs.) Modules that we write ourselves can be made available, then, in at least six ways, the fifth and sixth of which are to be preferred for reasons described below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put them in the current directory, that is, the directory where you’re developing the program that is going to use the functions defined in the module.\n",
    "1. Add the directory in which they reside to PYTHONPATH permanently.\n",
    "1. Add the directory in which they reside to PYTHONPATH temporarily.\n",
    "1. Copy or move them manually into a directory included in your PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "1. Contribute them to PyPI and then install them using `pip`.\n",
    "1. Install them automatically into a directory in your PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is suitable if you’re going to use the module in only one location, but if you want it to be available in more than one project, you don’t want to have to copy or move or link it to all of them. The second isn’t scalable because your PYTHONPATH will grow out of control over time in you keep adding directories to it. The third isn’t portable; if your script loads a module by first adding its system location to PYTHONPATH, other users may not have put that module into the same location on their systems (especially if they use different operating systems). The fourth is awkward because it’s manual, and if you want to distribute your module, many of your users may not even know that they have a PYTHONPATH, or how to find the directories it includes. The fifth is suitable if your module is mature enough to merit publication and interesting enough to merit distribution, which may not always be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth strategy, then, is the only one that is flexible, scalable, portable, and suitable for modules that may not yet be sufficiently mature to merit publication on PyPI. But in order to install a module automatically into a directory in your PYTHONPATH, since you can’t use `pip` to install modules that exist only in your local filespace (and not on PyPI), you need to learn about Python packaging, which is the focus of the rest of this tutorial.\n",

In real life we’d incorporate robust error trapping (e.g., what if the arguments aren’t numbers? what if the input is longer than the return length after padding?), and we’d make our code more elegant and less clunky, but since the point of this tutorial is packaging and not error handling, we’ll sacrifice robustness and elegance for brevity, directness, and clarity and offer the following, which assumes that both of the arguments to the `lpad()` function are non-negative integers and that the length after padding will be longer than the string length of the input value:"
