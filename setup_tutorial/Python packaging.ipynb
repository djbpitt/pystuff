You can install any of these from the command line with the command `pip install packagename`. For example, to install the [CollateX](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collatex/2.1.0) collation toolkit, type `pip install collatex` at the command line. You can then import from CollateX the same way you import from `re`. Once you’ve installed a PyPI module with `pip`, you can import and use it in the same way as you import and use standard modules. But what about modules you write yourself, or others that are not distributed through PyPI?\n",

    "Much as we can import functions from modules that are part of the standard Python distributions (like `re`) or that we install from PyPI (like CollateX), we can import functions from modules that we write ourselves. But we can do that only if Python can find those modules. Python finds modules by consulting a search space, which by default is, in order (copied from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).\n",
    "1. PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).\n",
    "1. The installation-dependent default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Builtins are always available, and both standard modules and those installed from PyPI with `pip` are placed into a location that is part of PYTHONPATH. Modules that we write ourselves can be made available, then, in at least five ways, the fifth of which is to be preferred for reasons described below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put them in the current directory, that is, the directory where you’re developing the program that is going to use the functions defined in the module.\n",
    "1. Add the directory in which they reside to PYTHONPATH permanently.\n",
    "1. Add the directory in which they reside to PYTHONPATH temporarily.\n",
    "1. Copy or move them manually into a directory included in your PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "1. Install them automatically into a directory in your PYTHONPATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is suitable if you’re going to use the module in only one location, but if you want it to be available in more than one project, you don’t want to have to copy or move or link it to all of them. The second isn’t scalable because your PYTHONPATH will grow out of control over time in you keep adding directories to it. The third isn’t portable; if your script loads a module by first adding its system location to PYTHONPATH, other users may not have put that module into the same location on their systems (especially if they use different operating systems). The fourth is awkward because it’s manual, and if you want to distribute your module, many of your users may not even know that they have a PYTHONPATH, or how to find the directories it includes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth strategy, then, is the only one that is flexible, scalable, and portable. But in order to install a module automatically into a directory in your PYTHONPATH, you need to learn about Python packaging, which is the focus of the rest of this tutorial.\n",
